  "Based on all the sources above, some common points can be drawn out: in general, the causes of various revolutions share two similarities, which are respectively the severely and pervasive unfair treatment and certain inborn natures within human beings. How? As we have seen in recent instances, the factors causing the rebellions can be extreme humiliation, inhuman oppression, and poor living conditions, or it can also be the human's inborn desire for freedom and elevated expectations driven by heightened evlution. Indeed, numerous specific factors can lead to a revolution. However, that is why 'in general' is used above. If we inspect these closely: extreme humiliation, inhuman oppression, and poor living conditions are all heading towards or stemming from one word---'unfairness'. Humiliation is originated from prejudice and unfairness. Oppression contributes to bias and unfairness. Impoverished living conditions experienced by specific groups can be either the result of unfairness or the producer of unfairness. With the same approach, we observe the other causes: inborn desire for freedom, and higher expectations led by high intelligenceâ€¦ similarly, they can be categorized as components of humans' inherent qualities. Therefore, on a broad scale, there are 2 main reasons for the arising of so many revolutions in human history: unequal treatment and humans' inborn natures.";
